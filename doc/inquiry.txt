Introduction:                                       *InquiryIntro*

This plugin installs new command to VIM editor: Inquiry.
The command helps to querysome development libraries or references in the web.
Please, see NOTES below to use in Windows OS.

Nowadays, the libraries / references the command is able to search are:

Search Engines:                                     *InquirySE*
    - MSDN (Microsoft Development Network)
    - CPP (Cplusplus.com)
    - OSX (Apple OSX developer library)
    - IOS (Apple IOS developer library)
    - MDN (Mozilla Developer Network )(Javascript)

Usage:                                              *InquiryUsage*

The usage of Inquiry command is as follows:

:Inquiry {msdn|cpp|osx|ios|mdn} [keyword1 [keyword2] ...]

The first parameter is mandatory and tells inquiry where to search. 
The second is optional. If exists Inquiry will instruct the library's 
search engine to seek to keywords specified. 
Otherwise if no keyword is passed to command, 
Inquiry wil copy the word under cursor and use it as a keyword.
All searches will open in the default OS browser.


Requirements:                                       *InquiryReq*

You MUST have Python 2.6 or 2.7 to make Inquiry works.


Note:                                               *InquiryNote*

I've developed this in a Macintosh, so I use the OSX command Open to start a browser. 
In Wiindows, I advise to use a simple trick to make Inquiry works: since you must 
install python, create a file name open.bat with the text below and put it into 
a folder which shall be in user's PATH:

@echo off
python -c "import sys;os.system(\"start \"+sys.argv[1])" "%1"
